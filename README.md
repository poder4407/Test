(WARNING it only works only in windows with 64 bits!!!)
How to use the screensaver: first, download the rar folder(its a compressed file), then extract it.
Go to this direction in your folder "C:\Windows\SysWOW64" and leave the file.

To reset the game press the r key.
If you want to get out press any other key.
