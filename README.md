(WARNING it only works only in windows with 64 bits!!!)
How to use the screensaver: first, download the rar folder(its a .zip file), then extract it.
When you extracted it, dont open the file. Instead go to this direction in your folder "C:\Windows\SysWOW64" and leave the file.

Before you start it, take note this is a test version and to get out of this screen saver you have to pres the key "Esc" other keys wont work.
PRESS THE Esc KEY TO GET OUT.
